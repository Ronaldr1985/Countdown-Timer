# Countdown Timer Go

A simple countdown timer, it was built to be an alternative to the sleep command on Linux.

## Usage

Well, first of compile the application. And then run it passing it the time you want to sleep for. So for example:

./main 5m30s # Which would sleep for 5 minutes and 30 seconds

Please note this application is still very much in **testing**.
