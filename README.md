# Countdown Timer Go

A simple countdown timer, it was built to be an alternative to the sleep command on Linux.

## Usage

First things first compile the application: 

    go build main.go

 And then run it passing it the time you want to sleep for. For example:

So to sleep for 5 minutes and 30 seconds

    ./main 5m30s 

Please note this application is still very much in **testing**, and is still being developed.
